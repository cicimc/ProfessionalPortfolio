## Homework 2

Professional Portfolio -
Creating a portfolio of work samples.

## In my Website

I have a title named Ciemone's Portfolio. I have an navigation bar of what you will see on my page. You will be able to click on any of the links in the navigation bar and it will take you to that part of the page. My header is a greeting and my name. My picture of myself is also apart of the greeting. Clicking on about me you will see a short bio of 'Ciemone'. Clicking on Portfolio you will see pictures that are links to other webpages. The pictures in portfolio will grow when hovered over it. You will be able to click the pictures at the portfolio part. It should take you to different pages. When clicking Contacts you will see how to contact 'Ciemone'. I also have a footer with 'Made by Ciemone' in it.
